I am currently a graduate student at Shandong University, majoring in English translation. 

I love food and tourism! My favorite thing is to go out and play with friends. I also enjoy playing games, currently playing with the codenames Kite (代号鸢) and Love and Deep Space (恋与深空) ! If you have friends who also enjoy playing these games or are in Jinan, you can contact me!
